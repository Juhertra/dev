## Red/Yellow Flags
- [ ] Any failing required check (ruff, pyright, import-linter, unit, contracts, docs-health)?
- [ ] Coverage below ratchet target?
- [ ] Contract test failing (finding invariants / storage layout)?
- [ ] Docs health failing (mermaid parity, ASCII blocker)?
- [ ] Security policy change without @security-lead review?
- [ ] Blocked issue idle >24h without owner update?

## Coordinator Decision
- **GO / NO-GO**: <pick one>
- Notes: <short rationale, blockers, reassignment>
