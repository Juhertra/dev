# Docs Health (M0 closeout)

## Health Gate Output

```console
$ make health
python scripts/mermaid_parity_gate.py && python scripts/ascii_html_blocker_gate.py
Mermaid parity: source=45 rendered=45
ASCII blocker: CLEAN
```

### Manual Count Verification
```console
$ rg -n '```mermaid\s*$' docs | wc -l
45

$ rg -n '<div class="mermaid">' -g site/**/*.html | wc -l
45
```

## Governance Page Deltas Made Today

### Coverage Ratchet Updates Applied
Updated both governance pages to include M0 coverage baseline:

**Engineering Standards** (`docs/governance/engineering-standards.md`):
- ✅ Added M0: 18% minimum coverage (baseline) to Coverage Ratchet Ladder
- ✅ Updated milestone thresholds to match current CI implementation

**Development Conventions** (`docs/governance/development-conventions.md`):
- ✅ Added M0: 18% minimum coverage (baseline) to Milestone Thresholds
- ✅ Updated coverage ratchet information to match CI reality

### Exact Thresholds Map Applied
```
M0: 18%, M1: 80%, M2: 82%, M3: 84%, M4: 86%, M5: 88%, M6: 90%
```

## Navigation Checks

### Governance Pages Status
- ✅ **Engineering Standards**: Linked in navigation and from developer-start-here.md
- ✅ **Development Conventions**: Linked in navigation and from developer-start-here.md
- ✅ **Navigation structure**: Both governance pages discoverable
- ✅ **API Documentation**: Overview page prepared for M6 mkdocstrings

### Navigation Verification
```console
$ grep -A 5 "Governance:" mkdocs.yml
  - Governance:
      - Engineering Standards: governance/engineering-standards.md
      - Development Conventions: governance/development-conventions.md
  - API Documentation:
      - Overview: api/README.md
```

### Internal Links Status
- ✅ All governance page links functional
- ✅ Developer-start-here.md properly links to both governance pages
- ✅ Navigation structure complete and accessible

## M0 Closeout Status

### Health Gates: ✅ GREEN
- **Mermaid parity**: PERFECT (45/45)
- **ASCII blocker**: CLEAN
- **Fence hygiene**: All Mermaid blocks properly formatted

### Governance Alignment: ✅ COMPLETE
- **Coverage ratchet**: M0 baseline (18%) documented in both pages
- **CI order**: Documented correctly matches implementation
- **DoD checklist**: Complete and aligned with development practices

### Documentation Framework: ✅ READY
