## üöÄ **M1 Strategy & Launch Plan**

### **M1 Scope Definition**
**Goal**: Make the system functional end-to-end with basic execution and improved CI/testing rigor

#### **Core Features**
1. **Plugin Loader Implementation**: Dynamic plugin loading with security validation
2. **Sequential Workflow Execution**: Basic workflow execution (no concurrency)
3. **Real Tool Integration**: At least one real tool execution working end-to-end
4. **Coverage Improvement**: Achieve 80% test coverage (from 18% baseline)
5. **Security Enforcement**: Plugin signature verification and sandbox execution

#### **Success Criteria**
- **Functional**: All workflows run in non-error state with real plugins
- **Coverage**: ‚â•80% test coverage (M1 threshold)
- **Security**: No high-severity security findings, plugin validation working
- **Documentation**: Updated for new features, API documentation complete
- **CI Stability**: All 7 checks passing, no regressions from M0

### **M1 Task Breakdown**

#### **@tools-lead Responsibilities**
- **FEAT-041**: Plugin Loader Implementation
- **FEAT-042**: Tool Manifest Validation
- **FEAT-043**: Dynamic Plugin Discovery
