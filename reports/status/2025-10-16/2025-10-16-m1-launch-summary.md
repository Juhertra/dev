## üìã **M1 Development Guidelines**

### **CI Compliance Requirements**
- **No Red in Main**: All PRs must pass all 7 CI checks
- **Feature Flags**: Use flags for complex features until ready
- **Soft Mode Checks**: New checks in advisory mode until stable
- **Merge Train**: Continue coordinator-managed serialized merging

### **Development Process**
- **Daily Reports**: Continue daily status reports from all leads
- **Weekly Sync**: Add weekly cross-team coordination meetings
- **Issue Management**: Link related issues across teams
- **Scope Management**: Defer M2+ features, maintain M1 focus

### **Quality Standards**
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum (from 18% M0 baseline)
- **Security**: No high-severity findings
- **Documentation**: API docs updated for new features
- **Testing**: Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
