**Generated**: 2025-10-16 (UTC)  
**Coordinator**: M1 Project Coordination & Integration  
**Status**: Active M1 Oversight

---

## üö® **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED**

### **CI Pipeline Failure - CRITICAL**
**Issue**: Multiple CI workflows failing due to deprecated `actions/upload-artifact: v3`  
**Impact**: Blocking all M1 development work  
**Owner**: @devex-lead, @devops-lead  
**Action**: Update all workflows to use `actions/upload-artifact: v4`  
**ETA**: 30 minutes

**Affected Workflows**:
- Security Monitoring (sast-scan, secrets-scan, plugin-security-audit, dependency-audit)
- Contracts
- Imports  
- Pyright

**Fix Command**:
```bash
# Update all .github/workflows/*.yml files
find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" -exec sed -i 's/actions\/upload-artifact@v3/actions\/upload-artifact@v4/g' {} \;
```

## ü§ù **CROSS-TEAM DESIGN REVIEW SESSIONS**

### **Session 1: Workflow-Plugin Interface Alignment**
**Participants**: @workflow-lead, @runtime-lead, @tools-lead  
**Scheduled**: Immediate (once CI is fixed)  
**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Goal**: Define execution interfaces between workflow engine and plugin loader

#### **Key Decisions Needed**:
1. **Plugin Loading Interface**: How does WorkflowExecutor discover and load plugins?
2. **Execution Callbacks**: How does the workflow engine invoke plugin methods?
3. **Error Handling**: How are plugin errors bubbled up to workflow level?
4. **State Management**: How is state passed between workflow nodes and plugins?
5. **Lifecycle Management**: How are plugins initialized, executed, and cleaned up?

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Interface Specification**: Documented API contracts
- **Error Handling Protocol**: Standardized error propagation
- **State Management Schema**: Data flow between components
- **Integration Tests**: Stub implementations for testing

### **Session 2: Security Integration Review**
**Participants**: @security-lead, @tools-lead, @runtime-lead  
**Scheduled**: After Session 1  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Goal**: Integrate security requirements into plugin loader design

#### **Key Decisions Needed**:
1. **Plugin Verification**: When and how are plugin signatures verified?
2. **Sandbox Integration**: How does sandbox execution hook into workflow engine?
3. **Security Policies**: How are security policies enforced during execution?
4. **Audit Logging**: What security events need to be logged?
5. **Trust Model**: How is plugin trust established and maintained?

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Security Architecture**: Plugin security integration design
- **Policy Enforcement Points**: Where security checks occur
- **Audit Schema**: Security event logging format
- **Trust Model**: Plugin trust establishment process

### **Session 3: Observability Integration Review**
**Participants**: @observability-lead, @workflow-lead, @runtime-lead  
**Scheduled**: After Session 2  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Goal**: Define execution monitoring and metrics collection

#### **Key Decisions Needed**:
1. **Metrics Collection**: What metrics are collected during workflow execution?
2. **Performance Monitoring**: How is execution performance tracked?
3. **Error Tracking**: How are errors logged and categorized?
4. **Dashboard Integration**: What observability data needs visualization?
5. **Alerting**: What conditions trigger alerts?

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Metrics Schema**: Execution metrics data model
- **Monitoring Points**: Where metrics are collected
- **Dashboard Requirements**: Observability visualization needs
- **Alerting Rules**: Error and performance alert conditions

- **FEAT-056**: Coverage Improvement to 80% (#83) - @devex-lead - **INDEPENDENT**

### **Dependency Mapping**
```
FEAT-041 (Plugin Loader)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FEAT-050 (Signature Verification) [BLOCKED]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FEAT-051 (Sandbox Environment) [BLOCKED]

FEAT-044 (Execution Engine)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FEAT-047 (Orchestration) [BLOCKED]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FEAT-053 (Metrics Collection) [BLOCKED]

FEAT-047 (Orchestration)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FEAT-054 (Performance Monitoring) [BLOCKED]
```

### **Issue Management Actions**
1. **Create Missing Issues**: FEAT-051 (Sandbox Environment), FEAT-054 (Performance Monitoring)
2. **Update Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure all issues have clear, testable criteria
3. **Assign Dependencies**: Link blocking issues to unblocked issues
4. **Set Milestones**: Assign all M1 issues to M1 milestone
5. **Create Project Board**: Visual progress tracking across teams

## üîß **CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION OVERSIGHT**

### **Current CI Status**
- **Main Branch**: üî¥ **FAILING** - Deprecated upload-artifact v3
- **Required Checks**: 7 contexts (ruff, pyright, imports, unit, coverage, contracts, docs-health)
- **Security Checks**: 4 contexts failing (sast-scan, secrets-scan, plugin-security-audit, dependency-audit)

### **CI Enforcement Rules**
1. **No Red in Main**: All required checks must pass before any merges
2. **Merge Train Process**: One PR at a time, wait for CI before next merge
3. **Regression Prevention**: Full pipeline run after major feature merges
4. **Nightly EOD Reports**: Monitor for CI stability trends

### **CI Fix Priority**
1. **Immediate**: Fix deprecated upload-artifact v3 (30 min)
2. **Short-term**: Verify all 7 required checks pass (15 min)
3. **Medium-term**: Add M1-specific CI checks if needed (1 hour)

## üöÄ **FORWARD PLANNING - M2 & PYTHON 3.14 ADOPTION**

### **M2 Planning Focus Areas**
1. **Concurrency & Scalability**: Parallel execution capabilities
2. **Advanced Workflow Patterns**: Complex DAG execution
3. **Performance Optimization**: Execution engine improvements
4. **Advanced Security**: Enhanced plugin security features
5. **Observability**: Advanced monitoring and alerting

### **Python 3.14 Adoption Strategy**

#### **Risk Assessment**
- **Free-threaded Mode**: Officially supported but may have performance impact
- **Subinterpreters**: Extension module compatibility concerns
- **Dependency Compatibility**: Third-party library support status
- **CI Infrastructure**: Dual-version testing requirements

#### **Mitigation Plan**
1. **Early M2 Spike**: Convert project to Python 3.14 early in M2
2. **Compatibility Matrix**: Track dependency 3.14 support status
3. **Dual-version Testing**: Run CI on both 3.11 and 3.14 during transition
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure impact of free-threaded mode

#### **Team Readiness Assessment**
- **Tools/Workflow/Runtime**: Comfort with parallel execution in 3.14?
- **Security**: Concerns about no-GIL or subinterpreters?
- **DevOps**: CI readiness for 3.14 switch?
- **QA**: Testing strategy for 3.14 features?
