## 🔍 **EXTENSIBILITY VERIFICATION**

### **Plugin Loader/Wrapper Design Review**
**Goal**: Ensure easy addition of new tools

#### **Architecture Requirements**
1. **Minimal Changes**: Adding new scanner plugin requires only:
   - Drop in new wrapper class
   - Update plugin registry
   - No core code modifications

2. **Plugin Registry**: Centralized mapping of tool identifiers to classes
3. **Dynamic Loading**: Runtime discovery and loading of plugins
4. **Standardized Interface**: Common interface for all tool plugins

#### **Validation Criteria**
- **New Tool Addition**: Can add dummy plugin with minimal changes
- **Registry Update**: Plugin registry handles new entries automatically
- **Interface Compliance**: All plugins implement standard interface
- **Discovery Mechanism**: System can discover new plugins automatically

### **Example: Adding New Scanner Plugin**
```python
# 1. Create new wrapper class
class ScanNewTool(Plugin):
    def execute(self, config: dict) -> dict:
        # Implementation
        pass

# 2. Update registry (minimal change)
PLUGIN_REGISTRY = {
    "scan.nuclei": ScanNuclei,
    "scan.feroxbuster": ScanFeroxbuster,
    "scan.newtool": ScanNewTool,  # Only this line added
}

# 3. No core code modifications required
```
