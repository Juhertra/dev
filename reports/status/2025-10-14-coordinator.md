## DIFFS vs Plan/Docs

| Area | Expected | Actual | Gap | Owner |
|------|----------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Branch Protection** | Required checks: ruff, pyright, import-linter, unit-tests, contract-tests, docs-health, coverage-ratchet | Only "test" check enabled | Missing 6 required checks | @devex-lead |
| **Coverage Ratchet** | M1: 80% minimum | Current: 17% | 63% gap | @devex-lead |
| **CI Pipeline** | Phase 1-4 gates (ruff→pyright→tests→docs) | All phases failing | Complete CI failure | @devex-lead |
| **PR Size Limit** | ≤400 LOC or 2 approvals | Multiple PRs >400 LOC | Size enforcement missing | @devex-lead |
| **FEAT Hygiene** | All FEATs assigned + milestone | 100% complete | ✅ No gap | @coordinator |
| **PR Linking** | All PRs have "Fixes #" | 17 PRs missing links | PR linkage drift | @coordinator |
| **Docs Health** | Mermaid parity + ASCII blocker | ✅ CLEAN | ✅ No gap | @docs-lead |

## Blocking Risks (with Owners & Due Dates)

### 🔴 Critical (Blocking M0→M1)
1. **CI Infrastructure Failure** → @devex-lead → **Due: EOD today**
   - All Phase 1-2 gates failing (ruff, pyright, tests, coverage)
   - Blocking all development work
   - PRs: #47, #44, #42

2. **Coverage Baseline Missing** → @devex-lead → **Due: EOD today**
   - Current: 17% vs M1 target: 80%
   - MIN_COV=18% not established for M0
   - PRs: #70, #69

### 🟡 High (Blocking M1)
3. **Branch Protection Incomplete** → @devex-lead → **Due: Tomorrow**
   - Missing 6 required status checks
   - Only "test" check currently enabled

4. **PR Size Enforcement** → @devex-lead → **Due: Tomorrow**
   - Multiple PRs exceed 400 LOC limit
   - No automated enforcement

### 🟢 Medium (Process Issues)
5. **PR Linkage Drift** → @coordinator → **Due: Tomorrow**
   - 17 PRs missing "Fixes #" links
   - Manual enforcement needed

## What's Missing to Finish M0

### Infrastructure (Critical Path)
- [ ] **Fix CI Pipeline**: All Phase 1-2 gates must pass
  - Ruff linting (PR #47)
  - Pyright type checking (PR #47)
  - Import linter (PR #47)
  - Unit tests + pytest-cov (PR #44)
  - Coverage measurement (PR #69, #70)

- [ ] **Establish Coverage Baseline**: MIN_COV=18% for M0
  - Install pytest-cov
  - Configure coverage reporting
  - Set M0 baseline threshold

- [ ] **Complete Branch Protection**: Enable all required checks
  - ruff, pyright, import-linter
  - unit-tests, contract-tests
  - docs-health, coverage-ratchet

### Process (Quality Gates)
- [ ] **PR Size Enforcement**: Implement 400 LOC limit
- [ ] **PR Linkage**: Add "Fixes #" to all 17 open PRs
- [ ] **DoD Validation**: Ensure all PRs include validation evidence

### Documentation (Compliance)
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Complete mkdocstrings integration (M6)
- [ ] **Architecture Alignment**: Verify all implementations match docs

## Today's GO/NO-GO Decision

### 🔴 **NO-GO**

**Rationale**:
1. **Critical Infrastructure Failure**: All CI gates failing, blocking development
2. **Coverage Crisis**: 17% vs 80% M1 target (63% gap)
3. **Branch Protection Incomplete**: Missing 6 required checks
4. **Development Blocked**: No new work can proceed until CI fixed

**Unblock Actions**:
1. **@devex-lead**: Fix PRs #47, #44, #42 immediately
2. **@devex-lead**: Establish MIN_COV=18% baseline (PRs #70, #69)
3. **@devex-lead**: Complete branch protection configuration
4. **@coordinator**: Enforce PR linkage on all 17 open PRs

**Success Criteria for GO**:
- All Phase 1-2 CI gates passing
- Coverage baseline established (MIN_COV=18%)
- Branch protection fully configured
- PR linkage compliance at 100%

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. **@devex-lead**: Focus exclusively on CI infrastructure (PRs #47, #44, #42)
2. **@devex-lead**: Complete coverage baseline setup (PRs #70, #69)
3. **@coordinator**: Comment on all 17 PRs requesting "Fixes #" links

### Tomorrow
1. **@devex-lead**: Complete branch protection configuration
2. **@devex-lead**: Implement PR size enforcement
3. **Team**: Resume development work once CI gates pass
