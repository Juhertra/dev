# Projects v2 + Role Map Bootstrap Summary

## Secrets Verification

### Required Secrets Status
Both required secrets are present and properly configured:

| Secret | Status | Created | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| `PROJECTS_TOKEN` | ✅ **EXISTS** | 2025-10-18T16:54:31Z | Fine-grained PAT for Projects v2 API access |
| `PROJECTS_V2_ID` | ✅ **EXISTS** | 2025-10-18T16:54:43Z | GraphQL node ID of SecFlow Project (v2) |

### PAT Permissions
The `PROJECTS_TOKEN` is configured with the required permissions:
- **Projects**: Read/Write (Projects v2)
- **Issues**: Read/Write
- **Pull Requests**: Read/Write
- **Contents**: Read

## Role Map Configuration

### File Location
`.github/role-map.json`

### Role Assignments
All 12 roles are currently assigned to `Juhertra` for initial bootstrap:

```json
{
  "coordinator": "Juhertra",
  "integration-lead": "Juhertra",
  "devex-lead": "Juhertra",
  "devops-lead": "Juhertra",
  "qa-lead": "Juhertra",
  "docs-lead": "Juhertra",
  "runtime-lead": "Juhertra",
  "workflow-lead": "Juhertra",
  "tools-lead": "Juhertra",
  "findings-lead": "Juhertra",
  "security-lead": "Juhertra",
  "observability-lead": "Juhertra"
}
```

### Role Map Purpose
- **Board Automation**: Enables automatic assignee mapping based on role labels
- **Status Management**: Supports role-based status updates in Projects v2
- **Team Onboarding**: Easy to update as new team members join specific roles
- **Empty Assignment**: Roles with empty strings (`""`) won't auto-assign anyone

## Integration Capabilities

### Projects v2 Board Integration
- ✅ **Secrets Configured**: Both required secrets present
- ✅ **Permissions Set**: Proper PAT scopes for API access
- ✅ **Role Mapping**: Complete role-to-assignee mapping
- ✅ **Status Automation**: Ready for automatic status updates
- ✅ **Assignee Automation**: Ready for automatic assignee mapping

### Workflow Integration
- **Project Sync**: Can now set both Status and Assignees automatically
- **Status Sync**: Will update Projects v2 based on label changes
- **Role Handoffs**: Can automatically assign issues to role owners
- **Board Management**: Full automation ready for Projects v2 board

## Next Steps

### Immediate Capabilities
1. **Automatic Assignment**: Issues/PRs can be assigned based on role labels
2. **Status Updates**: Projects v2 status will reflect label changes
3. **Role Handoffs**: Journal handoffs can automatically assign work
4. **Board Sync**: Full Projects v2 board automation operational

### Team Expansion
1. **Update Role Map**: Modify `.github/role-map.json` as team grows
2. **Role Specialization**: Assign specific roles to different team members
3. **Workload Distribution**: Distribute roles across multiple people
4. **Empty Roles**: Leave roles as `""` if no assignee needed

## Security Notes

### Secret Management
- **PAT Security**: Fine-grained PAT with minimal required permissions
- **Repository Scope**: PAT scoped to this repository only
- **Audit Trail**: Secret creation/usage tracked in GitHub Actions logs
- **Rotation**: PAT should be rotated periodically per security best practices

### Role Map Security
- **Public File**: Role map is public (no sensitive information)
- **GitHub Usernames**: Only contains public GitHub usernames
- **No Tokens**: No secrets or sensitive data in role map
- **Version Control**: Changes tracked in git history
