# Phase 3: Advanced Security Testing Tool

## Overview

Phase 3 represents a comprehensive enhancement of the security testing tool with advanced pattern management, external integrations, comprehensive reporting, and REST API capabilities. This phase transforms the tool from a basic security scanner into an enterprise-grade security testing platform.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Port Configuration
The application runs on port 5000 by default. To change the port:
```bash
export PORT=5001
python app.py
```

## 🚀 New Features

### 1. Enhanced Pattern Engine
- **Per-project pattern directories**: Each project can have its own custom patterns
- **Community pattern packs**: Auto-updating pattern collections from OWASP, Nuclei, and other sources
- **External integrations**: Support for Nuclei templates and ModSecurity CRS rules
- **Advanced filtering**: Filter by severity, CWE, confidence, tags, and pack type
- **Pattern testing**: Test patterns against custom text with detailed results

### 2. Pattern Management UI
- **Comprehensive dashboard**: Statistics, filtering, and management interface
- **Pattern testing**: Built-in pattern testing with real-time results
- **Import/Export**: Support for JSON, CSV, and YAML formats
- **Community pack updates**: One-click updates from external sources
- **Pattern validation**: Built-in validation and error reporting

### 3. Comprehensive Reporting
- **Executive summaries**: High-level risk assessment and recommendations
- **Technical reports**: Detailed findings with OWASP mappings
- **Multiple formats**: HTML, JSON, CSV, and SARIF export
- **Risk scoring**: Automated risk assessment with weighted scoring
- **Priority recommendations**: Actionable remediation guidance

### 4. REST API
- **Full CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete findings and patterns
- **Analysis endpoints**: Submit requests for security analysis
- **Report generation**: Programmatic report generation and export
- **Statistics API**: Real-time project statistics and metrics
- **API key authentication**: Secure access control

- CRUD operations for findings and patterns
- Analysis and reporting endpoints
- Statistics and health checks

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Pattern Management
```python
# Initialize enhanced pattern engine
engine = EnhancedPatternEngine(base_dir, project_id)

# Get patterns with filters
patterns = engine.get_patterns_by_filter(
    severity="high",
    confidence_min=80,
    pack_type="community"
)

# Test a pattern
result = engine.test_pattern_against_text("pattern_id", "test text")

# Export patterns
engine.export_patterns("output.json", "json")
```

### Report Generation
```python
# Generate executive summary
reporter = SecurityReporter(project_id)
summary = reporter.generate_executive_summary()

# Export technical report
reporter.export_findings_json("report.json")
reporter.generate_html_report("report.html")
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Get findings
curl -H "X-API-Key: test-key-123" \
     "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/projects/test-project/findings"

# Analyze request
curl -X POST -H "X-API-Key: test-key-123" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"request": {...}, "response": {...}}' \
     "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/projects/test-project/analyze"

# Export report
curl -H "X-API-Key: test-key-123" \
     "http://localhost:5000/api/v1/projects/test-project/reports/export?format=html"
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **HTML**: Human-readable reports with styling

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set API Keys** (optional):
   ```bash
   export API_KEYS="your-api-key-1,your-api-key-2"
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   - Web Interface: http://localhost:5000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health

## 🔄 Migration from Phase 2

Phase 3 is fully backward compatible with Phase 2. Existing findings and patterns will continue to work without modification. The enhanced pattern engine automatically loads existing patterns and provides additional functionality.
