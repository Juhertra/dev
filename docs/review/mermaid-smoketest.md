# Mermaid Smoketest

This page tests that Mermaid diagrams are rendering correctly using the superfences + local Mermaid approach.

## ðŸ§ª Test Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Start] --> B[Process]
  B --> C[End]
```

## âœ… Expected Result

You should see a flowchart diagram above with three boxes connected by arrows.

## ðŸ”„ Sequence Diagram Test

```mermaid

    participant A as Alice
    participant B as Bob
    A->>B: Hello Bob, how are you?
    B-->>A: Great!
    A-)B: See you later!
```

    }
    class Dog {

    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
