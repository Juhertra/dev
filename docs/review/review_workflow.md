## 🚨 Escalation Procedures

### Critical Issues
**Definition:** Issues that could prevent implementation or compromise security

**Examples:**
- Security vulnerabilities in design
- Infeasible technical requirements
- Major architectural inconsistencies
- Compliance violations
- Timeline conflicts

**Escalation Process:**
1. **Identify** critical issue during review
2. **Document** issue with evidence and impact
3. **Notify** Lead Architect immediately
4. **Schedule** emergency review session within 4 hours
5. **Resolve** with all stakeholders present
6. **Update** review assignments if needed

### Non-Critical Issues
**Definition:** Issues that should be addressed but don't block implementation

**Examples:**
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Documentation improvements
- Code style suggestions
- Performance optimizations

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Document** issue in review report
2. **Assign** resolution responsibility
3. **Set** timeline for resolution
4. **Track** progress in issue tracking system
5. **Validate** resolution before final approval
