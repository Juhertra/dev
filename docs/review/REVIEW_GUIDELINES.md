## 🔍 Review Process

### Phase 1: Individual Review (Week 1)
Each team member reviews their assigned documents using the checklist above.

### Phase 2: Cross-Review (Week 2)
Team members review documents outside their primary expertise to catch inconsistencies.

### Phase 3: Group Review (Week 3)
Scheduled review sessions for each document category with all stakeholders.

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Week 4)
Lead architect consolidates feedback and validates final changes.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Escalation

### Immediate Escalation Required
- Security vulnerabilities in design
- Infeasible technical requirements
- Major architectural inconsistencies
- Compliance violations
- Performance bottlenecks

### Escalation Process
1. **Identify** the critical issue
2. **Document** the problem with evidence
3. **Notify** the lead architect immediately
4. **Schedule** emergency review session
5. **Resolve** with all stakeholders present

## 📊 Review Metrics
