# SecFlow Plugin Security Threat Model

## Overview
This document defines the threat model for the SecFlow plugin system, identifying assets, threat actors, and primary threats to guide security control implementation.

## Assets Protected

### Primary Assets
- **Plugin Runtime Environment**: Core execution environment for plugins
- **Plugin Loader**: Component responsible for loading and validating plugins
- **Plugin Manifests**: Metadata files describing plugin capabilities and permissions
- **YAML Workflow Recipes**: User-defined workflow configurations
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, filesystem, and network access
- **Sensitive Data**: Findings, configurations, and user data processed by plugins

### Secondary Assets
- **Plugin Registry**: Repository of approved plugins
- **Security Policies**: Plugin security configuration and constraints
- **Audit Logs**: Security event logging and monitoring data
- **Signature Keys**: Cryptographic keys for plugin verification

## Threat Actors

### External Threat Actors
- **Malicious Plugin Developers**: Developers creating plugins with malicious intent
- **Supply Chain Compromise**: Attackers compromising plugin distribution channels
- **Script Kiddies**: Low-skill attackers using automated tools
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**: Sophisticated attackers with long-term objectives

### Internal Threat Actors
- **Insider Abuse**: Authorized users misusing their privileges
- **Compromised Accounts**: Legitimate accounts taken over by attackers
- **Social Engineering**: Attackers manipulating users to bypass security controls

## Primary Threats

### 1. Code Execution Attacks
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Malicious plugins executing unauthorized code
- **Privilege Escalation**: Plugins gaining elevated system privileges
- **Remote Code Execution**: Plugins executing code from external sources

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious plugin manifests with dangerous node types
- YAML deserialization attacks
- Plugin signature forgery
- Sandbox escape techniques

### 2. Data Exfiltration
- **Sensitive Data Theft**: Plugins accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information
- **Configuration Disclosure**: Plugins revealing system configurations
- **User Data Harvesting**: Plugins collecting user information

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthorized filesystem access
- Network communication to external servers
- Memory dumps and process inspection
- Log file access

### 3. System Compromise
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Plugins consuming excessive system resources
- **Denial of Service**: Plugins causing system unavailability
- **System Modification**: Plugins modifying system files or configurations

**Attack Vectors:**
- CPU and memory exhaustion attacks
- Infinite loops and recursive operations
- File system modification
- Network flooding

### 4. Supply Chain Attacks
- **Plugin Tampering**: Modification of plugins during distribution
- **Dependency Poisoning**: Compromise of plugin dependencies
- **Manifest Spoofing**: Creation of fake plugin manifests

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on plugin distribution
- Compromise of plugin registry
- Dependency confusion attacks
- Signature forgery

## Threat Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Malicious Plugin Execution
**Actor**: Malicious plugin developer
**Objective**: Execute arbitrary code on the system
**Method**: 
1. Create plugin with malicious manifest
2. Bypass signature verification
3. Execute code with elevated privileges
4. Exfiltrate sensitive data

**Mitigations**:
- Plugin signature verification
- Sandbox execution environment
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Audit logging

### Scenario 2: Supply Chain Compromise
**Actor**: Advanced persistent threat
**Objective**: Compromise plugin distribution
**Method**:
1. Compromise plugin registry
2. Inject malicious code into legitimate plugins
3. Distribute compromised plugins
4. Execute malicious code on target systems

**Mitigations**:
- Cryptographic signature verification
- Plugin integrity checking
- Secure distribution channels
- Regular security audits

### Scenario 3: Insider Abuse
**Actor**: Authorized user with elevated privileges
**Objective**: Misuse system access
**Method**:
1. Create plugins with excessive permissions
2. Bypass security controls
3. Access sensitive data
4. Modify system configurations

**Mitigations**:
- Principle of least privilege
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Regular access reviews
- Separation of duties

## Security Control Mapping

### Prevention Controls
- **Plugin Signature Verification**: Prevents unauthorized plugin execution
- **Sandbox Execution**: Isolates plugin execution environment
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks

### Detection Controls
- **Audit Logging**: Records security events for analysis
- **Security Monitoring**: Detects suspicious plugin behavior
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual resource usage patterns
- **Signature Verification**: Detects plugin tampering

### Response Controls
- **Plugin Termination**: Stops malicious plugin execution
- **Resource Quotas**: Limits plugin resource consumption
- **Network Isolation**: Prevents data exfiltration
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for security incidents

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Threats
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: High impact, medium likelihood
- **Privilege Escalation**: High impact, low likelihood
- **Data Exfiltration**: High impact, medium likelihood

### Medium Risk Threats
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Medium impact, medium likelihood
- **Denial of Service**: Medium impact, low likelihood
- **System Modification**: Medium impact, low likelihood

### Low Risk Threats
- **Information Disclosure**: Low impact, low likelihood
- **Audit Trail Tampering**: Low impact, very low likelihood

## Security Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Plugin signature verification must be implemented
- **FR-2**: Sandbox execution environment must isolate plugins
- **FR-3**: Resource limits must be enforced
- **FR-4**: Audit logging must record all security events

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Security controls must not impact performance by more than 10%
- **NFR-2**: Security monitoring must detect threats within 5 minutes
- **NFR-3**: Incident response must be initiated within 15 minutes
- **NFR-4**: Security updates must be deployed within 24 hours

## Threat Model Validation

### Testing Scenarios
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attack scenarios
- **Red Team Exercises**: Test security controls effectiveness
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identify security weaknesses
- **Security Code Review**: Analyze code for security issues

### Metrics and KPIs
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Time to detect security incidents
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: Time to respond to security incidents
- **False Positive Rate**: Rate of false security alerts
- **Security Control Coverage**: Percentage of threats covered by controls
