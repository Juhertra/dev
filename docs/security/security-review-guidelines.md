- [ ] **Supply Chain**: Supply chain security considerations

#### Configuration
- [ ] **Secure Defaults**: Secure default configurations

### 4. Workflow Security Review

#### Recipe Validation
- [ ] **Schema Validation**: Workflow recipes validated against schema
- [ ] **Node Security**: No dangerous node types (shell, exec, eval)
- [ ] **Reference Validation**: Node references properly validated
- [ ] **External Resources**: External resources properly validated

#### Execution Security
- [ ] **Sandboxing**: Workflow execution properly sandboxed
- [ ] **Resource Limits**: Resource limits enforced
- [ ] **Isolation**: Proper isolation between workflows
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Execution properly logged

## Security Review Process

### 1. Automated Security Checks
- **Bandit SAST**: Static analysis for security issues
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **YAML Security**: YAML parsing security validation
- **Plugin Security**: Plugin policy compliance checking

### 2. Manual Security Review
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review
- **Architecture Review**: Security architecture assessment
- **Threat Modeling**: Threat model analysis
- **Penetration Testing**: Security testing (if applicable)

### 3. Security Approval Criteria
- **No High Severity Issues**: No high-severity security issues
- **Medium Issues Addressed**: Medium-severity issues documented and mitigated
- **Security Controls**: Appropriate security controls implemented
- **Documentation**: Security considerations documented

## Security Review Tools

### Static Analysis
```bash
# Run Bandit security linter
bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json

# Run Safety dependency audit
safety check --json

# Run plugin security audit
python tools/plugin_security_audit.py
```

### Dynamic Analysis
```bash
# Run security tests
pytest tests/test_plugin_security.py

# Run workflow security tests
pytest tests/test_workflow_security.py
```

## Security Review Responsibilities

### Security Lead
- **Primary**: Security architecture and policy
- **Secondary**: Plugin security and sandboxing
- **Review**: Security-sensitive changes

### Development Team
- **Primary**: Code security implementation
- **Secondary**: Security testing
- **Review**: General security practices

### DevOps Team
- **Primary**: Infrastructure security
- **Secondary**: Dependency management
- **Review**: Deployment security

## Security Review Escalation

### Escalation Criteria
- **High Severity Issues**: Immediate escalation to Security Lead
- **Medium Severity Issues**: Document and plan remediation
- **Low Severity Issues**: Include in technical debt

### Escalation Process
1. **Identify Issue**: Security issue identified
2. **Assess Severity**: Determine severity level
