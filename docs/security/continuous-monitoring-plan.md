# Continuous Security Monitoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the continuous security monitoring strategy for SecFlow, ensuring ongoing security posture maintenance and threat detection.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Continuous Assurance Model
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Immediate threat detection and response
- **Periodic Assessment**: Regular security posture evaluation
- **Trend Analysis**: Long-term security metrics and patterns
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ongoing compliance status tracking

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Automated Security Scanning

#### Daily Scans

### 2. Real-time Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
```python
# Security event logger
class SecurityEventLogger:
    def log_plugin_execution(self, plugin_name: str, result: str, duration: float):
        event = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "event_type": "plugin_execution",
            "plugin_name": plugin_name,
            "result": result,
            "duration": duration,
            "severity": "info"
        }
        self._write_event(event)
    
    def log_security_violation(self, violation_type: str, details: dict):
        event = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "event_type": "security_violation",
            "violation_type": violation_type,
            "details": details,
            "severity": "high"
        }
        self._write_event(event)
```

#### Anomaly Detection
- **Resource Usage Anomalies**: Unusual CPU/memory consumption patterns
- **Execution Time Anomalies**: Plugins taking longer than expected
- **Access Pattern Anomalies**: Unusual filesystem or network access
- **Error Rate Anomalies**: Increased security-related errors

### 3. Security Metrics Dashboard

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)**: Average time to respond to security incidents
- **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of false security alerts
- **Security Control Coverage**: Percentage of threats covered by controls

#### Security Posture Metrics
