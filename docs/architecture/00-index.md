# SecFlow â€” Architecture & Design Documentation Index

Welcome to the **SecFlow** technical documentation suite.  
This collection defines the *complete internal architecture* of the Security Toolkit platform â€” covering everything from orchestration engines to data models, plugin systems, and CVE enrichment.

Each document in this `/docs/architecture/` folder represents a **bounded architectural domain**, written in *deep-technical mode* to serve engineers and architects implementing or extending the system.

## ðŸ§­ Reading Order

While each document is standalone, recommended order for new contributors:

1. Start with **01â€“04** to grasp architecture and structure.  
2. Proceed to **05â€“07** for orchestration and integration.  
3. Review **09â€“13** for data, findings, and enrichment logic.  
4. Study **16â€“18** for security and observability.  
5. Conclude with **19â€“23** for governance, testing, and roadmap.

---

## ðŸ§© Versioning & Maintenance

- Documentation version follows codebase major versions (e.g., `1.0` = `v1.x` releases).  
- Each architectural change **must update its corresponding file** and cross-links.  
- Use `mkdocs serve` locally to preview rendered docs.  
- Changes to interfaces or DTOs require schema diff logs.
