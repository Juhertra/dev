# 24 â€” Final Consensus Summary

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This document consolidates the **final architectural consensus** between ChatGPT and Cursor regarding the design, structure, and roadmap of the SecFlow platform.

It serves as the **canonical closure** of the initial R&D phase and provides a clear blueprint for implementation.

---

## ðŸ§± Core Consensus Highlights

| Aspect | Consensus Decision | Rationale |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Architecture Pattern** | Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) | Enforces separation of concerns, testability, and modularity |
| **Repository Structure** | Mono-repo with Poetry | Simplifies dependency management and cross-package development |
| **Workflow Engine** | DAG-based orchestration | Enables complex tool chaining and parallel execution |
| **Plugin System** | Decorator-based registration | Provides clean extensibility without complex frameworks |
| **Security Model** | RBAC + Sandboxing | Balances usability with security requirements |
| **Data Model** | Pydantic + SQLModel | Ensures type safety and database integration |

---

## ðŸ§± Foundational Architecture Principles

### 1. **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
- **Core business logic** isolated from I/O concerns
- **Ports** define interfaces, **Adapters** implement them
- **Dependency inversion** ensures testability and modularity

### 2. **Event-Driven Design**
- **Asynchronous workflows** using Celery/RQ
- **Event sourcing** for audit trails and replay capabilities
- **Pub/Sub patterns** for loose coupling

### 3. **Immutable Data Flow**
- **Findings** are immutable once created
- **Versioned resources** for reproducibility
- **Audit trails** for all data modifications

### 2. **Applications Structure**

    E["admin/<br/>(Administrative tools)"]
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
```

### 3. **Workflow Orchestration**
- **YAML-based DAG definitions** for tool chaining
- **Node-based execution** with parallel processing
- **Error handling** with retry logic and circuit breakers
- **Caching** for intermediate results and resource reuse

### 4. **Security Model**
- **JWT-based authentication** with role-based access control
- **Sandboxed execution** for external tools and PoCs
- **Fernet encryption** for sensitive data storage
- **Audit logging** for all security-relevant operations

---

## ðŸ§± Risk & Compliance Integration

### Frameworks Adopted
- **NIST 5x5 Risk Matrix** for business risk assessment
- **CVSS v3.1** for technical severity scoring
- **CWE/OWASP** for vulnerability classification
- **MITRE ATT&CK** for attack pattern mapping

### Risk Formula
```text
Risk Score = (Likelihood Ã— Impact) Ã— Contextual_Factor
Where:
- Likelihood = CVSS_Exploitability + EPSS_Score
- Impact = CVSS_Impact + Business_Criticality
- Contextual_Factor = Asset_Value + Exposure_Level
```
